Hi there 👋  
I’m Venkatesh, a data science and machine learning engineer based in India.  
I enjoy working with data, building clean ML systems, and keeping things simple and practical.

These days I’m focused on:

- End-to-end machine learning projects using Python  
- Data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation  
- Turning raw data into clear, actionable insights  
- Building small but complete systems with real-world relevance  

Some things I’ve built:

- **Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction**  
  An end-to-end machine learning project analyzing airline service data to predict customer satisfaction.

- **AI Data Analyst Platform**  
  A natural language–driven system that converts user queries into executable data analysis workflows and visualizations.

Background:

- QA Testing Engineer Intern at Versa Networks  
- Experience working on enterprise network security systems  
- Comfortable with Linux environments and Git-based workflows  

A few personal notes:

- I like clean design, minimal code, and structured thinking  
- Interested in machine learning, NLP, and scalable data systems  
- Outside tech: gym, anime, and staying consistent

Thanks for stopping by.
