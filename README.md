Hi there! 👋  
I’m Venkatesh, a data science and machine learning engineer based in India.  
I like working with data, building practical ML systems, and keeping things clean and simple.

These days I’m focused on:

- Python-based machine learning projects  
- Data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation  
- Turning raw data into clear, actionable insights  
- Small, thoughtful projects with real-world relevance  

Some stuff I built:

- **Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction**  
  An end-to-end machine learning project analyzing airline service data to predict customer satisfaction.

- **AI Data Analyst Platform**  
  A natural language–driven system that converts user queries into executable data analysis workflows and visualizations.

Background:

- QA Testing Engineer Intern at **Versa Networks**  
- Worked on enterprise network security systems  
- Comfortable with Linux environments and Git-based workflows  

Fun facts:

- I like clean design and structured thinking  
- Anime & gym keep me balanced  
- Always focused on consistency over shortcuts  

Thanks for stopping by 🙂
