Hi there! 👋  
I’m Venkatesh, a data science and machine learning engineer based in India.  
I like working with data, building practical ML systems, and keeping things clean and simple.

---

These days I’m focused on:

- 📊 End-to-end machine learning projects using Python  
- 🧠 Data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation  
- 🔍 Turning raw data into clear, actionable insights  
- ✨ Small, thoughtful projects with real-world relevance

Some stuff I built:

- **✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction Prediction**  
  An end-to-end machine learning project analyzing airline service data to predict customer satisfaction.

- **🤖 AI Data Analyst Platform**  
  A natural language–driven system that converts user queries into executable data analysis workflows and visualizations.
